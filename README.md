In my 13+ years of experience, I've engaged in conceptualizing, designing, developing, and deploying AI (and Gen AI) powered products and solutions across pharmaceuticals, insurance, healthcare, high tech, realty, finance, and other industries.

Currently, I'm focused on creating multi-agent systems to automate operations and decision making processes. My responsibilities include working closely with domain experts on new problem areas, deeply understanding the challenges, conceptualizing solutions, and leading cross-functional teams to build 0-to-1 products. It also includes me working with executive leadership and sales team to plan and execute product marketing and commercialization.

Through my work and independent learning, I have developed expertise in cross-pollinating concepts and frameworks of ML/AI, design thinking, and many other domains to solve novel problems. My future aspiration is to tackle increasingly complex and system level challenges to develop innovative solutions.

I'm pursuing Executive MBA from The Wharton School alongside my full time job. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (University of Delhi). 

I've orthogonal interest in exploring AI application in VC, PE, public policy, and other relatively untouched areas. I'm continuously on the outlook for new challenges and opportunities.
