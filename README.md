### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My interest in Data Science and Design Thinking pulled me towards the career path of a Data Scientist. With an aim to further my knowledge and experience in ML/AI-based product design, development, and deployment; I am continuously on a lookout for opportunities of advancement.

Currently, I am working as a Data Science Manager at ZS developing ML/AI-based products and solutions for a technology client. I have ~8 years of experience in ML, AI, and advanced analytics.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (University of Delhi).

If you wish to, feel free to get in touch with me at connect.nishantgupta@gmail.com. Just include a note if we don't know each other personally! Same goes for adding me here as a connection.

More details will be added soon
